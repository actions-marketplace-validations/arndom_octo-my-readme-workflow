## How to use

1. Star this repo üòâ
2. Go to your special repository(repo with name the same as git username).
3. Create a folder named `.github` and create a `workflows` folder inside it, if it doesn't exist.
4. Create a new file named `octo-lang.yml` with the following contents inside the workflow folder:

```yaml
name: Octo my README 

on:
  # schedule: # Run workflow automatically
  #   - cron: '0 * * * *' # Runs every hour, on the hour
  workflow_dispatch: # Run workflow manually (without waiting for the cron to be called), through the Github Actions Workflow page directly

jobs:
  get_user_data:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: Get Language & Generate Ocoto-lang
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Get most used language then generate ocoto lang
      id: octo-lang
      uses: arndom/octo-my-readme-workflow@v0.27
```

5. Commit and trigger it manually and after the run, a  `my-ocoto-lang.png` file will be created in your repository.
6. You can display it in your `README.md` like this:

```markdown
<p> Here is arndom's ocoto-lang:</p>
<img src= "./my-octo-lang.png" width="400px"/>
```

The result:

<p> Here is arndom's ocoto-lang:</p>
<img src= "./my-octo-lang.png" width="400px"/>
